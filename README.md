## Plan
### 1. Determine how to communicate
Text-based communication is recommended, as messages can be viewed later, allowing team members to participate at the times that they are available.
### 2. Select graphic design software
Using Google Web Apps or Microsoft Office Online is recommended to create the image you wish to use.
### 3. Decide how you will collaborate
Real-time collaboration is the recommended form of collaboration (Everyone working and commenting on the same document at the same time). Available with Google Web Apps and Microsoft Office Online.
